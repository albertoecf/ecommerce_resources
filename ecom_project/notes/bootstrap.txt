3. Download content and insert into project -> statics -> css
4. add STATIC_ROOT in settings.py
4.1 add STATICFILES_DIRS (in this case we use [os.path.join(Path(__file__).resolve().parent,'static'),]) to match our directory configuration : ecom_project/ecom_project/static. Base directory is ().parent.parent that would send to ecom_project/static which is not the case. And that's why we can not use BASE_DIR= os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')

Basically the STATIC_ROOT is the location on the server where the files that are consumed on demand by the django project are stored, such as images, css files, javascript, etc.

The idea Static_URL or dirs is to create an internal structure inside the STATIC_ROOT to organize directories folders where the static files (images, js, css, etc) will be located.

In other words the STATIC_URL or dirs are just references to the location of the static files inside the ROOT.
