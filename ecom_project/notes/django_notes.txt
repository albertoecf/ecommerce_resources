Django setup  (after env configuration):
1. activate virtual/conda env
2. Go to the desired directory
3. run: django-admin startproject project_name
4. cd into project folder
5. run : python manage.py runserver

Model View Template pattern

6. Connect urls to views
7. Templates : Create a folder template

Static files :
python manage.py collectstatic

Working with apps :
8. python manage.py startapp app_name
9. settings.py add the app in INSTALLED_APPS
10. include new app url in project urls.py
11. connect new app url with its views.py file
12. Create a template to render app reponses

Link project template to app named path
13. In new app urls file create a variable app_name = 'app_users'
14. In project template 'app_users:user_list'

Models -> Interact with Databases to interact with dynamic data
(Within the app you want to use to manage this type of object)
15. models.py : We should create a class which attributes will be stored as columns in our databases
16. Excecute migrations : python manage.py makemigrations

Admin panel :
17. python manage.py createsuperuser
18. Go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin"
19. Register apps you'd like to manage from you app / admin

Connect app with db:
20. our_app views.py clas.object.all()

We will add functionalities by creating apps :
21. python manage.py startapp app_category, app_users, app_products ..
21.1 settings.py add app
22. Within our new app , create a Model / register in new_app/admin.py
22.1 python manage.py migrate , python manage.py makemigrations

-- fix --
In Django, the verbose_name attribute is used to specify the human-readable name for a model field or model itself.
The verbose_name_plural attribute is similar, but specifies the name to use for the model in the plural form.
These attributes are important because they allow you to specify more descriptive and user-friendly names for your models and fields
(That's why in our apps where we use "Class" to refer to the model, we need to set this properties in readable value)
Migrate and make migrations after that
